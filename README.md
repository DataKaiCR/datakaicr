Hello. I am Heinz. 

And welcome to DataKai. This is my main github repository where I do my best to post any projects that might be half interesting and half useful.

There is some quick backstory you will have to endure to know me better:

I started my business intelligence journey back in 2015 while I was working my way through a Big Four consulting company. Once I learned how vlookup formulas helped me automate some pesky recurring tasks, it was like taking the red pill and I've spiraled down the rabbit hole ever since. I truly believe that any professional should learn basic business intelligence skills, regardless of trade; ranging but not limited to a bit of automation, APIs, optimization, quality control, or just mingling data from multiple sources to make something out of it. If any of this sounds too familiar, then you might find my projects interesting.

Fast forward a few years and the excel formulas have evolved into fully orchestrated pipelines that can harvest data regardless of structure and make something out of it. DataKai is presented as an initiative to cover that journey, with the hope of assisting anyone that is interested in mastering this trade. My projects aim to be simple but effective, and use a variety of skills to add robustness and improve quality. Keep in mind by simple I don't mean minimum effort, so I take my time to post anything new. 

I'll do my best to cover proper documentation for each one. Just beware that these are early days, so I'm still working on putting everything together one step at a time. 

If you have any questions feel free to contact me through hstecher@datakai.net.

Have fun.
